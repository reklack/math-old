I feel that you are too modest IN THE ABSTRACT, not to MENTION IN MORE DETAIL THE MAIN RESULTS ON QUADRATIC MAPS. In particular I would like you to MENTION THERE THE ALGORITHM STATED BRIEFLY ON PG. 50. Even if it takes one more page of abstract.

%pg. 48  REPEAT THE SETTING (even if it fills one page) instead of saying in Prop. 3.3.1 that n,d,N,M,T  are as before.

pg. 50  middle:  STATE THE OBSERVATION AS AN ALGORITHM, with well defined steps
